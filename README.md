 1. Retrieve the current price of Bitcoin from Coindesk every hour and store it in this Google Sheets file.

2. At midnight each day, the hours when Bitcoin's highest and lowest price occurred get recorded in the same Google Sheets file.

3. The most common (mode) times for the highest price and lowest price times are calculated.

4. The accuracy of these modes is calculated by dividing the number of times the mode occurred for the high/low times by the total number of data points.
